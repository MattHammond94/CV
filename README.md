# :space_invader: Matt Hammond | Full Stack Developer :space_invader:

My story starts as a child who drew on walls A LOT! I couldn’t contain my desire to create. As I grew up, I naturally ended up tinkering on silly animations and found myself completing a degree(BA hons) in Animation Production.  

I started to think about what I love about animation. The reason I chose to study animation at university is that working as part of a team to see a project, start at design phase, continue through experimentation and testing and then successfully reach completion is not only something that brings me joy but is something I find extremely rewarding. Creating animation requires immense attention to detail, rigorous tinkering and close collaboration in order to create a polished and functioning final piece of work. After completing the Makers Academy bootcamp I have quickly come to find that working as a developer offers all of these aspects.  

I’m looking for a role as a developer because I want to push myself by working in a career where every day I learn and grow. I want to be in an environment that is ever changing and innovative. And most importantly, as a Makers graduate, I want to MAKE things.  

I LOVE to create things! And I love when those things are designed well, are functional and they make people happy by improving their lives.

## :dart: Skills

#### Creativity
Having spent the vast majority of my youth and education focusing on my artistic skills, I have reached a high level of practical artistry. I have a keen eye for interesting, intuitive and functional design and I approach any endeavour from an innovative perspective. I love to push creative boundaries and this clearly comes through in my approach to solving problems and writing code.

#### Attention to Detail 
My artistic endeavours have also provided me with meticulous attention to detail and these skills were later honed whilst working as a software test analyst for Ageas LTD. This role involved carefully checking(and then double checking) that every aspect of a completed fix/release/new piece of software was as it should be. I successfully worked on a multitude of projects and releases and I was directly responsible for locating and resolving multiple defects which, if gone undiscovered would have caused large problems for both the company and our clients alike.
My close attention to detail has proved invaluable when it comes to locating a bug in my code or working with a pre-existing codebase that I have not seen or used before. It has allowed me to digest and understand new/existing code with little difficulty.

#### Excellent Communicator
I am a clear and confident communicator. Communication has been absolutely vital to my success when working with clients on creative projects and also whilst working for Ageas LTD. Both roles, whilst very different, required the ability to communicate clearly and concisely to overcome (sometimes very complex) issues.
Whilst working for Ageas my role involved communicating with many different areas of the business in a multitude of mediums (telephone, email, teams, zoom etc.) I was regularly conversing with new people from different areas of the business to showcase findings, reach a mutual understanding and collaboratively come to solutions. I have always been able to convey ideas simply and sophisticatedly.

#### Versatile
On top of working in a large variation of job roles(from working in high pressure sales roles to labouriously working on multiple vineyards in the Australian outback.) I have been able to teach myself multiple complex computer programs(Photoshop, Maya, ToonBoom and AfterEffects) to enhance my skillset. I'm a fast learner who is able to grasp complex concepts and ideas with ease. 
This has allowed me to smoothly transition into coding. I've found learning new languages or researching an alternate method/technology to overcome a problem almost second nature and has been something I have easilly adjusted to.

#### Organized, Focused and Committed
I'm punctual, I'm used to working to strict deadlines and I have been able to consistently meet the targets set by my managers (in multiple departments) whilst working for Ageas LTD.
In March 2020 my stellar organizational skills and self-motivated attitude were put to the test when the company I worked for required all of its staff to work independently from home as a result of covid-19. Under unprecedented and somewhat manic circumstances, I showed the initiative to smoothly transition to working from home without any issues or the need for any technical support. I was one of the first in my department to be successfully set up and I offered technical support for others in my team who were struggling. My manager took the time to express his gratitude to me during this stressful period of transition and this was reflected in each of my end of quarter gradings that year.
I take pride in the work I produce. I never shy away from a task and I can be counted on to complete clearly outlined, conscientious work with initiative and to the best of my ability. I have been able to keep up with the overwhelming workload provided by Makers Academy and have required very little support or encouragement from the coaches to keep me motivated.
