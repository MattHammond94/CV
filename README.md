## Skills

#### Creativity
Having spent the vast majority of my youth and education focusing on my artistic skills, I have reached a high level of practical artistry. I have a keen eye for interesting, intuitive and functional design aspects and most importantly I have a deeply creative mind and outlook. I approach any endeavour from an innovative perspective. I love to push creative boundaries and this clearly comes through in my approach to solving problems and writing code.

#### Attention to Detail 
My artistic endeavours have also provided me with precise attention to detail and these skills were later honed whilst working as a software test analyst for Ageas LTD. Whilst working as a test analyst I was responsible for running tests on our completed software builds, capturing and showcasing evidence of the test results and conveying these results to other areas of the business to ensure changes were appropriately made.
I successfully worked on a multitude of projects and releases and I was directly responsible for locating and resolving multiple defects which, if gone undiscovered would have caused large problems for both the company and our clients alike.
My close attention to detail has proved invaluable when it comes to locating a bug in my code, learning a new language and implementing a new method/technology to overcome a problem.

#### Communication
I am a clear and confident communicator. Communication has been absolutely vital to my success when working with clients on creative projects and also whilst working for Ageas LTD. Both roles, whilst very different, required the ability to communicate clearly and concisely to overcome (sometimes very complex) issues.
Whilst working for Ageas my role involved communicating with many different areas of the business in a multitude of mediums (telephone, email, teams, zoom etc.) I was regularly conversing with new people from different areas of the business to showcase findings, reach a mutual understanding and collaboratively come to solutions. 
I have always been able to convey ideas simply and sophisticatedly without the need to pontificate. 

#### Versatility
On top of working in a large variation of job roles(from working at Greggs bakery to working on multiple vineyards in the Australian outback.) I have taught myself multiple complex computer programs to enhance my skillset (such as Photoshop, Maya, ToonBoom and AfterEffects.) I am a fast learner who is able to grasp complex concepts and ideas with ease. This has allowed me to smoothly transition into coding. I get genuine enjoyment and motivation from solving problems and overcoming new challenges. I love to learn and I love to gain new skills. 

#### Organization
I am NEVER late; I'm used to working to strict deadlines and I have been able to consistently meet the targets set by my managers (in multiple departments) whilst working for Ageas LTD.
In March 2020 my stellar organizational skills and self-motivated attitude were put to the test when the company I worked for required all of its staff to work independently from home as a result of covid-19. Under unprecedented and somewhat manic circumstances, I showed the initiative to smoothly transition to working from home without any issues or the need for any technical support. I was one of the first in my department to be successfully set up and I offered technical support for others in my team who were struggling. My manager took the time to express his gratitude to me during this stressful period of transition and this was reflected in my each of my end of quarter gradings that year. 

These skills have been put to the test throughout the course of makers...

#### Commited 
I take pride in the work I produce. I never shy away from a task and I can be counted on to complete clearly outlined, conscientious work with initiative and to the best of my ability.
