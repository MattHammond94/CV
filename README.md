## Skills

#### Creativity
Having spent the vast majority of my youth and education focusing on my artistic skills, I have reached a high level of practical artistry. I have a keen eye for interesting, intuitive and functional design aspects and most importantly I have a deeply creative mind and outlook. I approach any endeavour from an innovative perspective. I love to push creative boundaries and this clearly comes through in my approach to solving problems and writing code.

#### Attention to Detail 
My artistic endeavours have also provided me with precise attention to detail and these skills were later honed whilst working as a software test analyst for Ageas LTD. Whilst working as a test analyst I was responsible for running tests on our completed software builds, capturing and showcasing evidence of the test results and conveying these results to other areas of the business to ensure changes were appropriately made.
I successfully worked on a multitude of projects and releases and I was directly responsible for locating and resolving multiple defects which, if gone undiscovered would have caused large problems for both the company and our clients alike.
My close attention to detail has proved invaluable when it comes to locating a bug in my code, learning a new language and implementing a new method/technology to overcome a problem.

#### Communication

#### Versatility
On top of working in a large variation of job roles(from working at Greggs bakery to working on multiple vineyards in the Australian outback.) I have taught myself multiple complex computer programs to enhance my skillset (such as Photoshop, Maya, ToonBoom and AfterEffects.) I am a fast learner who is able to grasp complex concepts and ideas with ease. This has allowed me to smoothly transition into coding. I get genuine enjoyment and motivation from solving problems and overcoming new challenges. I love to learn and I love to gain new skills.
